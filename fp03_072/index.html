            <div class="content">
              <p>With a selection that spans nourishing breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, the majority of our meals are single serving and perfectly sized for 1 person 
                to enjoy at 1 sitting. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which are designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. 
                These delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing meals, simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal—the choice
                 is yours!</p>
              <p>We offer anywhere from 4–12 meals per week, with meals as low as $8.99 each—and you always have 
                the freedom to flex your number of meals up each week to add on breakfast items*, which are unlocked upon your second order. 
                On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do offer a 12 meal per 
                week subscription (it’s ideal for couples or a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple subscriptions. We may be 
                biased, but there’s no better feeling than a fridge full of Freshly!</p>
              <p>*Each breakfast item counts towards your 12-meal maximum.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they have a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-5 days. 
                Select items (such as seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the package to let you know. We usually suggest enjoying 
                these meals within the first few days of receiving your order, but you can always check their exact use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition 
                label. If you’re ever unable to finish your meals within their shelf life, you can always pop them into the freezer for extended storage. Just be 
                sure to microwave your meal straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the 165° F internal temperature we recommend.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat ‘em up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, 
                you’ll find our easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). If you’re 
                unsure, start at 2 minutes and heat in 30–second increments until the meal reaches an inner temperature of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to 
                be heated in the microwave (for the ultimate convenience), but you can heat them in the oven if you’d like. Just so you know, our current meal 
                containers aren’t safe for the oven or stovetop, so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it up. You can check out the full oven reheat directions 
                in our <b style="color: #3167ff; text-decoration: underline;">FAQs.</b></p>

                can reach you will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier delivering your Freshly meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your typical
